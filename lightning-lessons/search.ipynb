      "\n",
      "Finnish baseball, known as pesäpallo, is a combination of traditional ball-batting team games and North American baseball, invented by [\"Tahko\" Pihkala](Lauri)(Lauri Pihkala) in the 1920s. The basic idea of pesäpallo is similar to that of baseball: the offense tries to score by hitting the ball successfully and running through the bases, while the defense tries to put the batter and runners out. One of the most important differences between pesäpallo and baseball is that the ball is pitched vertically, which makes hitting the ball, as well as controlling the power and direction of the hit, much easier. This gives the offensive game more variety, speed, and tactical aspects compared to baseball.\n",
